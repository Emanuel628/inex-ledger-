## GPS Guidance Ideas

1. **Phase-aware fragile guidance** – When the user is fragile, the coach copy should reflect “First cushion wins.” Break the guidance into anchoring (what’s calm), breathing (focus on safe habits), and action (small deposits). Tie each phase to the buffer percent so the card can switch nuance as the cushion grows.

2. **Balanced coaching for steady/stable** – Once stable, the guidance can highlight momentum *and* resilience: celebrate protecting recent gains while laying out the next buffer milestone. Inject optional “when the cushion is at X%” triggers so the text evolves (e.g., “You’re safe at 70% of essentials; now aim for 85% before expanding opportunity funds.”).

3. **Purpose-driven thriving narration** – For thriving tiers, keep the tone choice-centric: “You already have reserves; how would you like to deploy them?” Share curated suggestions (e.g., nest egg, opportunity fund, giving) while reminding the user that the cushion should remain intact. Optionally surface context cues (seasonal, recent plan changes) to make this feel deeply personal.

4. **Seasonal/context hooks** – Feed `statusState.guidanceLine` and the coach-drawer copy with small adjustments when relevant (e.g., holiday spending, tax season, rainy-day needs). That keeps messaging aligned with both math and emotional truth, and it’s a natural follow-up to your “tier truth + buffer truth” mission.

Use this note as a reference when you expand the GPS logic so each tier story feels precise and alive.
