## Luna Financial OS Terms of Service

### 1. Scope
The Luna Financial OS is a privacy-first intelligence platform. By using Luna, you agree to the practices in this document and acknowledge that Luna does not provide personalized financial advice or fiduciary services.

### 2. Methodology Clause
The Service utilizes a Deterministic Logic Engine to process User-provided data. All outputs, including “Tiered Insights,” “Mastery Blueprints,” and “Formula Cards,” are mathematical derivations of the User’s 90-day financial snapshot. These outputs are delivered as computational models—not as personalized fiduciary advice. The User acknowledges that any “target,” “benchmark,” or “goal date” is a system-generated variable based on the chosen OS mode (Traditional/Optimized) and the user’s verified data.

### 3. Privacy & Consent
Users authorize Luna to ingest only the data necessary to deliver the chosen service mode. Consent is required before any bank/OAuth connection is initiated, and consent revocation triggers the `PURGE_EVENT` workflow which severs Stripe/Plit tokens and clears the identity and vault silos.

### 4. Export Disclosures
Exports include SHA-256 fingerprints and an audit trail entry so recipients can verify integrity. When an export is shared with a third party (e.g., accountant), the accompanying “System Integrity Report” and Circular 230 note make clear that the data is for informational purposes only and final tax characterization must be verified by a qualified professional.

### 5. No Fiduciary Relationship
Luna is an operating system, not a licensed advisor. You remain responsible for any decisions you make. The System is deterministic—everything the OS surfaces is derived from your encrypted inputs, and human personnel do not interpret or alter the models.
