      <h2>Beta disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        InEx Ledger is offered in V1 beta. The experience aims to deliver a clean ledger you can trust today.
        Enhancements may arrive while we collect feedback, but the core bookkeeping workflow is stable for
        real-world use.

    <section>
      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        The app processes data exactly as entered. We are not liable for inaccuracies you submit,
        nor for indirect damages. You are responsible for the records you keep, and you should
        share them with a CPA for definitive advice.
      </p>

      <h2>Data handling overview</h2>
      <p>
        We collect what you provide: account information, transactions, receipts, exports, and
        session data. The data may be stored in the United States and is protected by TLS, hashed credentials,
        and least-privilege access controls.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Not tax advice</h2>
      <p>
        Any estimates shown are informational and provided for planning purposes only. InEx Ledger does not
        offer professional tax, legal, or accounting advice, and using the app does not create a professional
        relationship.
