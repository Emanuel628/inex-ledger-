      <h2>Your data is kept safe</h2>
      <p>
        InEx Ledger stores the minimum data needed to provide your bookkeeping app.
        That includes account email, authentication/session information, ledger entries,
        receipts, exports, and usage signals. The data may be processed and stored in the
        United States and is governed by U.S. law while remaining compliant with PIPEDA
        transparency expectations for Canadian users.
      </p>

      <h2>Data we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Account credentials and email</li>
        <li>Auth/session tokens</li>
        <li>App usage and navigation data</li>
        <li>Financial entries you enter (transactions, receipts, recurring data)</li>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data we do not sell</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. That means no targeted advertising or profiling
        for sale. Your data stays within InEx Ledger unless you explicitly export it yourself.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>New Jersey data privacy law (effective Jan 15, 2025) guarantees:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access and correction of your data</li>
        <li>Deletion and portability of your records</li>
        <li>Opt-out of targeted advertising, sale, or profiling</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How to exercise rights</h2>
      <p>
        Use <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Data</strong> to change your preferences, download
        data, or request deletion. For manual requests, email
        <a href="mailto:support@lunabusiness.com">support@lunabusiness.com</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Account and ledger data is retained until a deletion request is honored. Business
        data may remain in backups only as required by law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        Passwords are hashed before storage, TLS encrypts every request, and access follows
        least-privilege principles. We monitor for suspicious behavior to keep your records safe.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Canada GST/HST note</h2>
      <p>
        If you are in Canada and your total taxable revenue exceeds $30,000 CAD within
        twelve months, you may have obligations to register and collect GST/HST. Use InEx Ledger
        to keep clean records, and consult your advisor for the next steps.
